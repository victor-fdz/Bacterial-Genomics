# Bacterial-Genomics🧬💻
In this repository you will find **own scripts💡** used to solve specific parts of diverse exercices in the context of the subject "**Bacterial Genomics**🔬".
All the code is hard-written and compiled from *Jupyter Notebook*⚙️, but can be easily adapted to be executed in terminal/console⌨️ using sys.argv module, for example. 
Example data (those used in the exercise) is available in the repository.

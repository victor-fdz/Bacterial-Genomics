# Bacterial-Genomics🧬💻
In this repository you will find some **scripts that I created💡** to solve specific parts of diverse exercices in the context of the subject "**Bacterial Genomics**🔬".

All the code is hard-written in **python** and compiled from **Jupyter Notebook**, but can be easily adapted to be executed in terminal/console⌨️ using sys.argv module, for example.
It uses famous packages⚙️ such as *matplotlib*, *pandas* and *numpy*.
Example data (those used in the exercises) is available in the repository.


## 📁 `DEG_analysis`
This folder contains 3 folders with the files used to adress 3 different parts of an exercise about RNA-seq data.
- 📁 `COG_terms`: files used to match COG terms to our DEGs.
- 📁 `FPKMs_plotting`: files used to plot FPKMs' dsitribution.
- 📁 `FoldChange_plotting`: files used to plot fold changes' distribution.

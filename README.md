# Bacterial-Genomics
In this repository you will find self-made scripts used to solve specific parts of diverse exercices in the context of the subject "**Bacterial Genomics**".
All the code is hard-written and compiled from Jupyter Notebook, but can be easily adapted to be executed in terminal/console using sys.argv module, for example. 
Example data (those used in the exercise) is available in the repository.
